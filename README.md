Hi!

This is one of my first independent projects, during which I wanted to my JavaScript. I created this project after only few days of learning JS, so propably in code you can
find some mistakes and lack of proper optimization. I would be greatful for tips that would make my code looks cleaner.


You can see my Password Generator here -> https://piotr-kuras97.github.io/passwordGenerator/

At the moment my project is available only in Polish.
